## **Slowest Programming Language**

###### _Product of Trash Software Studio_

Slowest Programming Language (SPL) is a light-weight scripting language.

SPL focuses on making codes simpler. Here's the general idea: 

* Code should be simple and easy for reading. 
fancy-looking codes somehow shows your programming skills but harmful to readers.
So complicated syntax is not allowed in SPL. There should not be too much code 
in one line.

For these purpose, SPL does not support the following features:

* Multiple line expressions
* Sequential function calls

SPL Key Features:

* Dynamic variables
* Object oriented
* Functional programming
* Slow

### SPL Basic Syntax:

SPL uses braces `{` `}` as block indentation. 

Lines should be terminated by the line terminator `;`.lines with a back brace `}` can have terminator omitted.

SPL is a dynamic language. There is ne need for declaring type when declare a variable.
For example the expression:

`a = 1;`

declares a variable `a` and sets it to integer 1.

### SPL Built-in types:

SPL has several built-in types:

* `int` Integer
* `float` Floating point number
* `string` String literal
* `boolean` Boolean value, `true` or `false`
* `void` The type name of the `null` pointer
